RP-GO! is an exercise themed, mobile RPG game, built by team "git-push-git-paid" as our final project during our time at the [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) full-stack coding bootcamp.

Users will take on a variety of exercise based quests in order to level up their character and earn rewards! During a quest, the users location, step count, distance travelled and elapsed time will all be recorded and will contribute towards completion of the challenge.

Users can view their previous routes and statistics, view their rewards, change their character and view other users stats/routes.
